# @nhost/hasura-auth-js

## 1.3.0

### Minor Changes

- 6f0a3005: Complete sign-in when email+password MFA is activated
  It was not possible to complete authentication with `nhost.auth.signIn` in sending the TOTP code when email+password MFA was activated.
  An user that activated MFA can now sign in with the two following steps:
  ```js
  await nhost.auth.signIn({ email: 'email@domain.com', password: 'not-my-birthday' })
  // Get the one-time password with an OTP application e.g. Google Authenticator
  await nhost.auth.signIn({ otp: '123456' })
  ```

### Patch Changes

- Updated dependencies [6f0a3005]
  - @nhost/core@0.7.1

## 1.2.0

### Minor Changes

- c1613394: Extend deanonymisation options
  The Nhost Auth client method `auth.deanonymize` was only accepting `allowedRoles` and `defaultRole` as additional parameters. It is not possible to pass on an `options` parameter with the usual registration options such as `redirectTo`, `locale`, `metadata`, and `displayName`.
  The `auth.deanonymize` parameters are now strongly typed.

## 1.1.9

### Patch Changes

- 7c8f0926: add `devTools` option to the Nhost client
  The Nhost client now accepts a `devTools` parameter that can be used to inspect the authentication state machine with [@xstate/inspect](https://xstate.js.org/docs/packages/xstate-inspect/)
- 7c8f0926: use the [same methods and typings](https://github.com/nhost/nhost/tree/feat/vue/packages/core/src/promises) to interact with xstate machines in both `@nhost/hasura-auth-js`, `@nhost/react` hooks and `@nhost/vue` composables
  Both `@nhost/react`, `@nhost/hasura-auth-js` and `@nhost/vue` interact with the authentication state in a similar way. As a result, the same code was repeated three times, with risks of insonsistency and difficult maintainability. `@nhost/core` now contains the logic and Typescript interfaces that are used in the Vanilla client, React hooks and Vue composables.

### Patch Changes

- Updated dependencies [65a3061]
  - @nhost/core@0.5.2

## 1.1.3

### Patch Changes

- 58fa2a2: Improve loading status
  The `loading` status indicates the authentication is not yet known to the client when it starts. Once the client is ready, the authentication status is either signed in, or signed out.
  When the user was trying to authenticate, the `loading` status was set to `true` until the result of the authentication was known.
  The client now only return `loading: true` on startup, and in no other cases.
- 58fa2a2: Look for a valid refresh token both the URL and local storage
  When auto-signin was activated, the client was not taking into account the refresh token in the URL if a token was already stored locally.
  The user was then not able to authenticate from a link when the refresh token stored locally was invalid or expired.
  When auto-signin is activated, the client now checks and tries tokens from both the URL and the local storage, starting with the URL.

## 1.1.0

### Minor Changes

### Patch Changes

- b52b4fc: Bump xstate to latest version (`4.31.0`)
- d49b837: Rename `autoLogin` to `autoSignIn`, and deprecate `autoLogin`

## 1.0.15

### Patch Changes

- aa1fdf6: Fix `refreshSession`

## 1.0.14

### Patch Changes

- 5ee395e: Ensure the session is destroyed when signout is done
  The user session, in particular the access token (JWT), was still available after sign out.
  Any information about user session is now removed from the auth state as soon as the sign out action is called.
- e0cfcaf: fix and improve `nhost.auth.refreshSession`
  `nhost.auth.refreshSession` is now functional and returns possible errors, or the user session if the token has been sucessfully refreshed.
  If the user was previously not authenticated, it will sign them in. See [#286](https://github.com/nhost/nhost/issues/286)

## 1.0.10

### Patch Changes

- 2c97db6: Keep authentication status and access token in sync
  The authentication events where not set correctly, leading the main Nhost client not to update internal states of storage/graphql/functions sub-clients when using non-react clients.
  The use of private fields (`#`) is also avoided as they conflict with the use of proxies in Vue, leading to errors in the upcoming Vue library.
  Fixes #373 and #378
- Updated dependencies [2c97db6]
  - @nhost/core@0.3.9

## 1.0.9

### Patch Changes

- 058956b: Add missing provider types
  `strava`, `gitlab`, and `bitbucket` were missing from the list of providers in Typescript and are now available.
- 058956b: Add `emailVerified`, `phoneNumber`, `phoneNumberVerified`, and `activeMfaType` to User type

  Some information is missing in the `User` payload (see [this issue](https://github.com/nhost/nhost/issues/306)). The above properties have been added in the Typescript `User` type and are available when using Hasura Auth versions from [this pull request](https://github.com/nhost/hasura-auth/pull/128) (tentative version number: `0.5.1`)

## 1.0.2

### Patch Changes

- 6eeb9d2: Wait for the authentication status to be known before executing auth actions
  The auth client was able to start actions such as signUp or signIn before the authentication state was ready (e.g. before initial refresh token could be processed).
  This patch solves the problem in waiting for the authentication status to be known before running these actions.
- Updated dependencies [4420c0e]

## 1.0.1

### Patch Changes

- ab36f90: Correct access to user/session information through getUser/getSession/isReady function when authentication state is not ready yet
  In some cases e.g. NextJS build, `auth.getUser()`, `auth.getSession()` or `auth.isReady()` should be accessible without raising an error.

## 1.0.0

### Major Changes

- 744fd69: Use `@nhost/core` and its state machine

  `@nhost/nhost-js` and `@nhost/hasura-auth-js` now use the xstate-based state management system from `@nhost/core`.

  The client initiation remains the same, although the `clientStorage` and `clientStorageType` are deprecated in favor of `clientStorageGetter (key:string) => string | null | Promise<string | null>` and `clientStorageSetter: (key: string, value: string | null) => void | Promise<void>`.

### Minor Changes

- 744fd69: Unify vanilla, react and next APIs so they can work together
  React and NextJS libraries now works together with `@nhost/nhost-js`. It also means the Nhost client needs to be initiated before passing it to the React provider.
  See the [React](https://docs.nhost.io/reference/react#configuration) and [NextJS](https://docs.nhost.io/reference/nextjs/configuration) configuration documentation for additional information.

### Patch Changes

- 744fd69: remove `nhost.auth.verifyEmail`
  Theres's a /verify endpoint in hasura-auth, but the sdk is not even using it as
  1. the user follows the /verify link in the email
  2. hasura-auth validates the link, attaches the token and redirects to the frontend
  3. the sdk gets the refresh token from the url
  4. the sdk consumes the refresh token
